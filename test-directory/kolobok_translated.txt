Once upon a time there lived an old man and an old woman. One day the old man asked:

- Bake me a round bun, old woman.

- What can I bake it from? We have no flour.

- Oh, old woman! Scrape the flour box, sweep the bin; you'll probably gather some flour.

The old woman scraped the flour box, swept the bin, and gathered two handfuls of flour. She mixed it with sour cream, fried it in butter, and put it on the windowsill to cool.

The bun lay there for a while, then suddenly it rolled - from the window to the bench, from the bench to the floor, across the floor to the door, over the threshold into the hallway, from the hallway onto the porch, from the porch into the yard, from the yard through the gate, and further and further.

The bun rolled down the road, and a hare came to meet it:

- Bun, bun! I'll eat you!

- Don't eat me, little hare! I'll sing you a song, - said the bun and started singing:

I was scraped from the flour box,
And swept from the bin,
Kenaded with sour cream
And fried in butter,
Cooled on the windowsill;
I ran away from grandpa,
I ran away from granna,
It's not hard to escape from you, hare!

And it rolled away; the hare only saw it go!..

The bun rolled on, and a wolf came to meet it:

- Bun, bun! I'll eat you!

- Don't eat me, gray wolf! I'll sing you a song!

I was scraped from the flour box
And swept from the bin,
Kenaded with sour cream
And fried in butter,
Cooled on the windowsill;
I ran away from grandpa,
I ran away from grana,
I ran away from the hare,
It's not hard to escape from you, wolf!

And it rolled away; the wolf only saw it go!..

The bun rolled on, and a bear came to meet it:

- Bun, bun! I'll eat you.

- You can't eat me, clumsy one!

I was scraped from the flour box
And swept from the bin,
Kenaded with sour cream
And fried in butter,
Cooled on the windowsill;
I ran away from grandpa,
I ran away from grana,
I ran away from the hare,
I ran away from the wolf,
It's not hard to escape from you, bear!

And it rolled away again; the bear only saw it go!..

The bun rolled and rolled, and a fox came to meet it:

- Hello, bun! How pretty you are!

And the bun started singing:

I was scraped from the flour box
And swept from the bin,
Kenaded with sour cream
And fried in butter,
Cooled on the windowsill;
I ran away from grandpa,
I ran away from granna,
I ran away from the hare,
I ran away from the wolf,
I ran away from the bear,
It's even more certain I'll escape from you, fox!

- What a lovely song! - said the fox. - But you see, bun, I've grown old and hard of hearing; sit on my snout and sing it once more, a bit louder.

The bun jumped onto the fox's snout and sang the same song.

- Thank you, bun! Lovely song, I'd like to hear it again! Sit on my tongue and sing it one last time, - said the fox and stuck out her tongue.

The bun jumped onto her tongue, and the fox - snap! - ate it up.
