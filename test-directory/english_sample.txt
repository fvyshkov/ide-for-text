Hello World!

This is a sample English text file that we will use to test our AI agent's translation capabilities.

The file contains:
- Simple greetings
- Multiple paragraphs

Our AI should be able to read this file, translate it to Russian, and create a new file with the translated content while preserving the original structure and formatting.

This is a great test case for file operations and translation functionality!
