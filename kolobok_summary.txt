Kolobok is a Russian folk tale about a small, round bread that comes to life. An old man asks his wife to make him a bun. She scrapes together the last of the flour and makes a small, round bun called Kolobok. The bun comes to life and rolls away. On its journey, Kolobok meets several animals (a rabbit, a wolf, a bear) who want to eat it, but Kolobok sings a song and escapes. Finally, it meets a cunning fox who tricks Kolobok and eats it.
